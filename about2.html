        <p> NYC is a great place for runners! You can run in a park or on a designated greenpath; with a group or solo; on an outdoor track or on the city streets - NYC is a runners town  Yes, use common sense and realize that a jog down Broadway at the height of a business day or a solo run in Central Park in the middle of the night are NOT wise choices.  However, with some thought and planning, you can get out and have some great runs.</p>
        
      
           <p>If you are new to the city or to the sport, one of the best groups to check out is New York Road Runners (NYRR).  NYRR are the folks responsible for organizing the New York City Marathon - the largest marathon in the world(approximately 50,000 participants in 2017).  Not a marathoner? No problem.  NYRR sponsors group runs in city parks throughout the five boroughs and group training classes for beginners to experienced speedsters.  In addition to the annual marathon, NYRR sponsors road races at various distances throughout the year.</p>
          
            <p>Are you a serious runner?  There are local track clubs throughout the city for the serious runner - checkout the NYRR for information and links to the various club websites.  Are you a weekend warrior or beginner? Your local running store is a fantastic place to join a group run led by a store employee who is also an experienced runner.  The store led group runs  are a great way to learn about the local running scene and a terrific way to meet people.  And are you interested in turning your running habit into a force for good?  Yes, you too can join the ranks of these running "superheroes" who raise funds for a variety of causes. For example, Team in Training is an organization affilited with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society that trains runners for a variety of road races and triathlons and assist participants with fundraising for the organization.  There are other groups that follow this model - TEAM REEVE is affiliated with the Christoper and Dana Reeve Foundation. NYRR is affiliated with Fred's Team which fundraises for cancer and Team For Kids which fundraises for youth running programs.
