    <div>
    <div><p>Where to run in the city?  Get outside!  Go for a run in a park or on a path.  Check out the <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/places-to-go/running"> NYC Parks</a> for information and locations throughout the city.  Central Park, located in Mahanttan, is probably the "jewel in the crown" of the NYC Park system - and a runner's paradise.  There is a 6 mile perimeter roadway, closed to cars on evenings and weekends, which becomes one of the busiest training spots in the city during marathon training season.  There are killer hills (Cat and Harlem Hills), and nice flat straight sections (near Engineer's Gate) for a variety of training drills.  In addition to the paved roadways, there are dirt bridle paths that offer a nice change of training surface.  The bridle paths are lovely in the Spring when the park emerges from winter and the cherry trees blossom on the upper east side of the park and provide cooling shade during the long hot summer days.  And you have to run the dirt path around the Central Park Resevoir for the beautiful views of the city skyline day or evening.</p>
